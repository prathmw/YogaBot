Akshaya Ji: Used Puspalata Ji's referral link.
Hemlatha Ji: Verified under the name "Hlrockz."
Kenny: Verified under the name "Om Shanti."
Venkatesh Ji: Has two WhatsApp numbers and registered with a different number, which is why he appears as pending on your dashboard. However, we have manually added Venkatesh Ji's points to your dashboard in our system.
