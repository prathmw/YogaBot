( What is HABUILD ?
Habuild is a platform where we help people Build sustainable Habits in fact its how the name is derived
Ha -Habit
Build - Building.
We are a community driven company where our focus is Users meaning anything that we do is always
helping users to build a stronger habit. )

( BACK STORY
During Lockdown time when the entire world went online, Saurabh & Sheetal (ART OF LIVING
TEACHERS) started taking free YOGA sessions online & came across this problem that people are willing
to do exercise however its difficult to be consistent hence after lot of research & hit n Trial they came up
with some simple ways to help people with regularity.
After about 3 months paid sessions were started and that allowed more freedom to use better paid tools &
techniques which helped people even further. The sessions started with 10 people in June 2020 & as on
today (Oct 2022) we have around 7000 people doing YOGA EVERYDAY with us.
Co Founders
1. Sheetal Pungliya (IT Professional, FACE YOGA Expert, Art of Living Teacher)
2. Saurabh Bothra (IITian, Yoga Expert)
3. Anshul Agarwal (IITian, IIM Calcutta)
4. Trishala Bothra (IITian, London Business School, Zumba expert) )

( WORKING MODEL
We work on a FREEMIUM Model where we give people 6 days free to attend & understand as it is not like
a regular yoga class which focuses on outcomes like Weight loss or some issues, our only focus is helping
people become consistent. We give them a full experience of what our sessions would be like so that
there is no random expectation. )

( Customer Service/Helpdesk Number - yogaeveryday@habuild.in  8600087862 )
